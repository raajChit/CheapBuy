## üìñ Introduction 

**cheapBuy Extension** You may easily purchase any item through your preferred websites, such as Amazon, Walmart, Ebay, Bjs, Costco, etc., using the cheapBuy Extension, which also provides price comparisons for the same item across many websites. It often takes a lot of time to compare prices across many websites. Instead, you can install our plugin cheapBuy, which will automatically gather prices for the same item from many websites so you can compare them side by side. Your time and money will both be saved by this extension. CheapBuy is a one-stop shop for finding the lowest products to purchase online.
